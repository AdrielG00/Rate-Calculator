    <text class="title">ARS - Allstate Roadside Service</text><br>
    <div class="cheat-sheet-body">

      • TP email alias (ARS to TP): Allstate@transitpros.com<br>
      • Contracted Services: Medium & Heavy duty towing only<br>
      • LD units: client must dispatch to TP as MD<br><br>

      <text class="red-text">Communications:</text><br>
      - Intake: Phone call from client rep<br>
      - Emails: ARS will send an email with the dispatch details when providing PO over the phone<br>
      - TP to client follow ups/updates: Phone call, update client of the new ETA at dispatch and with any delays past ETA provided.<br>
      - ETA: Client rep will require an “ETA” to provide PO, provide 90 min ETA and let them know we will keep them
      updated if there are any <br><br>

      <text class="red-text">Coverage:</text><br>
      - Coverage Type: Verify with client rep<br>
      <text class="accident-text-double">Full, Mileage or Dollar Amount</text><br>
      - Coverage Limit: Verify with client rep if not fully covered<br>
      <text class="accident-text-double">Number of miles or dollar amount</text><br>
      - Loaded Miles: ALWAYS ASK client rep<br><br>
      <text class="red-text">Client Info:</text><br>
      - PO: “Call #”<br>
      - Special Instructions: Reps name and any special instructions at intake.<br><br>
      <text class="red-text">If unit is pulling a trailer:</text><br>
      Ask client rep for trailer coverage<br>
      <text class="accident-text-double">- Covered: Ask for 2nd PO, build 2nd move, note moves with connected move
        template</text><br>
      <text class="accident-text-double">- Not covered: Detail Coverage as “None” for the secondary asset on Step
        1</text><br><br>
      <text class="red-text">Connected Moves Procedure:</text><br>
      Notate both moves with ‘Connected Moves Template’<br>
      <text class="accident-text-double"> Connected Moves template:</text><br>
      <text class="accident-text-double">o [Move #1] – PO – Weight class - coverage</text><br>
      <text class="accident-text-double">o [Move #2] – PO – Weight class - coverage</text><br>
      <text class="accident-text-double">o Total vendor quote is $xxx.xx and reflects on [move #1]</text><br>
      Example:<br>
      - Move 1234567 – PO 112233444 – MD Auto – fully covered<br>
      - Move 7654321 – PO 112233445 – MD RV – fully covered<br>
      - Total vendor quote is $375 and reflects on move 1234567<br><br>

      <text class="red-text">Step 2:</text><br>
       Must verify all details and complete Step 2 with customer prior to dispatch.<br>
       If unit is not roadside or a true ERS breakdown. Gather the following details: <br>
      <text class="accident-text-double">o Last time unit was moved /driven / towed</text><br>
      <text class="accident-text-double">o Tire condition</text><br>
      <text class="accident-text-double">o Location on property – easily accessible?</text><br>
      <text class="accident-text-double">o Get pictures whenever possible: Unit, tires and location on
        property</text><br>
      <text class="red-text">If customer is not fully covered:</text><br> Inform customer of their coverage and let them
      know we will call to collect any overages prior to dispatch – advise them we accept Visa and Mastercard. Do not
      quote customer before making vendors calls<br>
      <text class="red-text">If unit is pulling a trailer but trailer was not disclosed on intake:</text><br>Call ARS to
      inform them of the secondary asset and confirm coverage.</text><br><br>
      <text class="red-text">Coverage Limit Overages:</text><br>
      <text class="red-text-accident">Mileage Overage:</text><br>
      Customer pays total loaded mile rate minus ARS covered miles rate.<br>
      If the vendors quote exceeds total loaded mile rate: Subtract the customers portion from vendor quote and add $150
      to get the amount we need ARS to approve. Follow quote approval procedures above.<br>
      <text class="red-text-accident">Dollar Amount:</text> <br>
      Customer pays total mile rate minus ARS dollar amount covered.<br>
      If the vendors quote exceeds total loaded mile rate: Take vendor quote minus dollar amount ARS is covering and add
      $150 to get the customers out of pocket.<br>
      <text class="red-text-accident">Full Coverage (ARS Rates)</text><br>
      <text class="accident-text">TP has contracted rates with ARS for MD & HD tows only. </text><br>
      - If ARS declines to send as MD, decline the call<br>
      - Service calls (non-tows): Advise client rep we are contracted for MD & HD towing only and decline the non-tow
      service<br>
      - If ARS asks for the cost on a MD or HD tow before they will issue PO: <br>
      - Use ARS rates to determine the contracted rate by state, weight class and loaded miles<br>
      - Inform ARS “Per our contracted rates, the cost is $XXX.XX. If there are any issues that would result in higher
      cost, we will call you for prior approval.”<br><br>

      - ARS quote approval procedure – vendor quote exceeds ARS rate<br>
      - If vendors quote exceeds rates, call ARS for quote approval. The expectation is resources have been utilized and negotiations have taken place before calling for quote approval.<br>
      - Approved: Enter “Client Quote” on move – Details Tab.<br>
      - Note move with quote approval template.<br>
      - Denied: Inform ARS we need the quote approved to proceed and they can call us back if approved to proceed.<br>
      - Note move with quote approval template.<br><br>

      <text class="red-text-accident"> ARS Quote Approval</text><br>
      *Must get approval before calling ARS from manager or TL if one is on duty – notate who approved*<br>
      If quote approval is being requested from ARS, the following needs be notated prior to calling ARS: <br>
      - Contracted Rate $<br>
      - Weight Class <br>
      - Overage amount being requested $<br>
      - Total client quote (Contracted rate + Overage) <br>
      After the call with ARS the following needs notated: <br>
      - Approved or denied <br>
      - Amount approved <br>
      - Reps name that approved or denied <br>
      <text class="red-text-accident"> *We MUST request updated paperwork showing the additional amount approved but it
        is not required to proceed with dispatch*</text> <br>
