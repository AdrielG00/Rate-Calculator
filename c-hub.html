      -Call vendor and see if they will work out a quote to get the unit to client requested destination with TP
      directly. The goal here is to work out billing with the vendor and get the unit to the delivery if we have one. If
      vendor is refusing and taking unit to their lot – confirm with PD this was a nonconsensual tow.<br><br>
