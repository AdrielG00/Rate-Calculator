    <text class="title">Gathering Quotes:</text><br>
    Vendors with higher move counts may give us better than pricing than others.  It is usually good to start with those closest to the breakdown.<br>
    Split Tow states (truck and trailer have to be towed separate) will need a wrecker for each unit.  Expect higher pricing and try to negotiate as best as possible. <br>
    Lead the conversation and get straight to the point.  We need to keep these as brief as possible in order to assess our options - offer the pertinent information along with our price target early in. <br>
    Make sure you notate who you speak with and the equipment being used in the quote notes. (ie: "HD wrecker" "Rotator & Wrecker" "Split tow")<br>
    Consult with your team lead within the first 45 minutes of working your move with your best options and seek direction if needed.<br><br>
    If you are unable to find assistance within network: <br>
    1. Expand the mileage in your vendors to 100 miles - it is not unusual for a company to have a truck running that far out, especially if near a major city.<br>
    2. If the delivery location is a dealership - see if they have any recommendations in the area.<br>  
    3. Use outside resources like truckdown and google in order sign up a new vendor who is able to assist. <br>

    <text class="title">Dispatching Moves:</text><br>
    Ensure that pricing is all in - taxes, tolls and credit card fees included. <br>
    Make sure to get approval from a team lead and collecting any out of pocket due before sending a move to a vendor.<br>
    *Vendor quote approval will be needed for quotes over TPG*<br>
    Make sure you are verbally dispatching the move information and confirming paperwork has been received.<br>
    Update quote notes with all important information. (ie: "Updated customer and email chain with eta" "Extended ETA w/ ARS on dispatch" "Client updated with service tomorrow")<br>
    <br><br>

    <text class="title">Move Confirmation:</text><br>
    Make sure to notate who you spoke with and accurate times (if available). <br>
    Clients must be updated (when applicable) when units vendors are on scene, units are picked up & delivered.<br>
    Be sure to use the templates provided for communicating these updates.<br>
