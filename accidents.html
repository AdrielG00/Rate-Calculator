    <p class="title">Accident Scenes:</p>
    Accident scene’s take priority over everything else. An accident scene should never be put aside to work 
another move or handle another situation. All available CSRs are expected to assist on accident scene 
moves with clear communication amongst the team. <br>
Be aware and clear of the situation. Is the unit clear of the road or blocking roadway? Is there cargo 
involved and what is the condition of it? How long ago did the incident occur? Are the police on scene?<br>
Utilize resources to fill in the blanks if a driver is not available: Client, PD if on scene, our tow provider 
(may know about the accident), google (news/social media may have images of the accident to assist)<br><br>

    
    - Work Fast - Notify ERS team and managers immediately after an accident scene intake – do not 
let this hold up next steps.<br>
- Verify all details and unit condition with driver if able. If driver is unavailable, utilize resources to 
fill in the blanks.<br>
- Get photos if able.<br>
- Determine if police are on scene<br>
o If no: Inform driver we will have an ETA momentarily. Advise driver if PD does show up,
let the officer know Transit Pros is sending a wrecker and to call TP immediately.<br>
o If yes: Inform TP is sending someone and confirm the police have not sent anyone. 
Speak to the officer directly if able.<br>
▪ Notify a manager or Senior CSR immediately<br>
- Find out what equipment vendor will use and a cost. If an all-in is not available, get the rates on 
equipment/labor and negotiate. <br>
o DO NOT dispatch a vendor without cost or equipment breakdown. <br>
o DO NOT send the first vendor with an ETA unless the cost lines up for the job – balance 
cost and time.<br>
- Have TP tow vendor take photos of unit and equipment on scene.<br>
➢ If PD has already called a vendor out or there is a wrecker on scene:<br>
- Find out who.<br><br>

o Call vendor and see if they will work out a quote to get the unit to client requested 
destination with TP directly. The goal here is to work out billing with the vendor and get 
the unit to the delivery if we have one - negotiate. If vendor is refusing and taking unit 
to their lot – confirm with PD this was a nonconsensual tow.<br>
▪ If nonconsensual PD rotation tow:<br>
• Update client immediately and let them know we will keep them 
updated.<br>
• Confirm the address of where the unit is being taken to<br>
• Request the vendors invoice and photos of unit and vendor equipment 
on scene.<br>
• Notify a manager.<br><br>
